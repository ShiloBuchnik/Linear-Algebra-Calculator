### This is a small calculator, made in my spare time, to help me do calculations in Linear Algebra 1 :D

The code showcases formulas and algorithms that were leraned throughout the course

**It has 3 modes:**
1. Single matrix operations: Finding reduced row echelon form, rank, determinant, inverse matrix and adjoint matrix (if they exist)
2. Square system of equations solver: Solving a square system of equations, using Cramer's rule
3. Matrix multiplication: Multiplying 2 matrices
