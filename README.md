### This is a linear algebra calculator, written solely in C

Made in my spare time, to help me do calculations in Linear Algebra 1;  
this code showcases formulas and algorithms that were leraned throughout the course.  
it was later expended to showcase algorithms and decompositions from Numerical Algorithms.  
  
**It has 4 modes:**
1. Single matrix operations: Finding reduced row echelon form, rank, determinant, inverse matrix and adjoint matrix (if they exist)
Also, finding LU, LDV and QR decompositions; as well as the Frobenius norm of the matrix
2. Square system of equations solver: Solving a system of equations, using Least Squares (and utilizing QR decomposition to do it)
*An older version of this calculator used Cramer's rule.
3. Matrix multiplication: Multiplying 2 matrices
4. Convolution: Finding the linear and circular convolution of 2 vectors
